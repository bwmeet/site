	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>
		B &amp; W Meet was originally run by <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmtracey">Sean</a> and Tim. The big city beckoned to Sean so now it’s just Tim. Back in our student days we’d often meet at the pub and talk about the web but wished that others would join us. Soon after the death of Steve Jobs we decided that we should be proactive so we made B &amp; W Meet.
