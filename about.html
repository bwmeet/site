                    <h2>Sean Tracey</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm a Creative Technologist working for a (lovely) company called Redweb. Alongside that I make quite a lot of little personal projects (most never get finished, but some find a form elsewhere) and I occasionally write articles for Linux User and Developer Magazine. Did I mention that I play Bagpipes? I play Bagpipes.</p>

                    <h2>Tim Stone</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I'm a front end developer at Redweb which means I get to make and break sites. I write tutorials for Web Designer magazine which usually focus on JavaScript things. I like reading and listening.</p>

                <p>
                    Back in our student days we'd often meet at the pub and talk about the web but wished that others would join us. Soon after the death of Steve Jobs we decided that we should be proactive; and so we made B &amp; W Meet.
