			<p>Hey all,<br>It's B &amp; W Meet 10 this month!<br>We can't believe that we've managed to do 10 of these things, So Tim and I want to do something a little different, Just this once...</p>
		</section>
		
		<h2>So, What's going on?</h2>

			<section class="large-box" id="details">
				<p>Because it's fun, cheap and has LASERS (everyone loves Lasers, Right?), we're organising a match or two of Laser Tag after work and before the pub. If Laser tag isn't your thing the don't worry, Things will be continuing as you've come to expect from 1930 at the Good ol' Slug and Lettuce, Bournemouth</p>

				<p>Now, Because B &amp; W Meet is funded by donations, our resources are limited, So we can't pay for everything. We've decided to use the cash from our <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/">wonderful sponsor</a> to pay for drinks as per usual. This means, If you'd like to join us in Laser Tag you can <a href="http://bwmeet10.eventbrite.co.uk/">grab a ticket</a> letting us know that you're coming and you can pay on the evening. You don't have to get a ticket but we'd much rather you did so we can get a rough idea of team sizes.</p>

				<p>Times are yet to be confirmed, But let's work with these assumptions for now...</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>18:30</h3><p>Start Laser Tag. Get <a>here</a> before this time.</p></li>
					<li><h3>19:30</h3><p>Finish Laser Tag and then head for the pub</p></li>
					<li><h3>19:45</h3><p>Drink away the pain</p></li>
				</ul>

		<h2>TLDR;</h2>

			<section class="large-box">
				<p>Laser tag - Then drinking</p>
				<p>Laser tag starts <a href="http://www.laserquestbournemouth.co.uk/">here</a> at <strong>18:30</strong>. Don't be late. You have to buy your own tickets. <a href="http://bwmeet10.eventbrite.com">Let us know you're coming</a> - It'll be around <strong>Â£10</strong> for the Laser tag, But we'll likely get a group discount on the night.</p>
				<p>Then it's drinks as usual at The Slug and Lettuce, Bournemouth</p>
